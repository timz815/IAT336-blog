        <h2>FOCUS</h2>
        <p class="para">
            With our new focus on preparing food, we narrowed down our context of use, user disability, and interaction.
        </p>
        <p class="para">

            The user we will foucs on is a client that has hand arthristis that decreases hand strength, and reduced grip endurance. In the kitchen, they would have problem holding the food stable enough to allow for cutting. Thus for the context of use, our assitive device will allow the user to properly hold there food by pressing down instead of gripping, so that they would be able to do food prep cutting at home.

        </p>
        <p class="para">

            For the human factors, our device uses both hands and wrist. However, there is less need for finger dexterity as the design tries to minimizing needing precise grip to hold down the food. The other body parts that are used include arms/shoulders to apply downward force. The interaction time will be as long as the user is cutting food. The amount of force the device requires to hold is medium, and the frequence of use will depend on user habits - this could be three times a day or a few times per week The deice requires the user of both hands.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
 
            The primary style of interaction with the design will be pressing such as downward with the palm or hand pressing which will reduce needing to pinch or grip for stability while they are prepping the food.
        <p class="para">

            Below are some iterations for our first itertions of the "EasyPress Board".

        <h2>ITERATION ONE</h2>

        <p class="description">
            For our first iteration, we played around with the concept of having a slider to move the food off the board for more convience.

        <h2>ITERATION TWO</h2>
        <p class="description">
            In the second iteration, we experimented with being able to extend the board so that the user has more space to work with (You can pull out the handles and another surface would slide out).
